I'm from LA's San Fernando Valley where I studied and practiced art for the majority of my life. I attended Los Angeles County High School where I was in the Visual Arts and Dance departments. Currently, I'm an Arts in Context major at The New School in New York City with a concentration in Visual Studies and Writing, and a Journalism + Design minor. 

My work mainly consists of poetry/essays, drawing/watercolor/collages/photography, graphic design, acting (SAG-AFTRA member), and dancing (ballet/modern). I predominantly explore issues of identity, mental illness and addiction, either consciously or subconsciously throughout my practice. I have a deep love for style, aesthetics, green tea, the color green, and walking.
